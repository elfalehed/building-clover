# building-clover
The roadmap to create a new programming language called "Clover"

## Why?
Two main reasons. I would learn something new about languages creation, compilers and so on, the second would be the benefits this thing can create helping out a bunch of fresh CS students struggling with the likes of C and Java

## How? 
I will basically try to share How i built this language and add semi-daily updates on it, I will create a Folder divided by multiple sections named by components or things you need to understand or read in order to create your own language

## When?
So I am writing this readme file on 04/10/2022 - 13:25 CEST and I am going to start sharing the updates today
